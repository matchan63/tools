tools for automating basic functions

So, folks, I'm just starting out with Git and its my intention to add to my Python skillset by experimenting with 
network automation, i've done a bit of one off stuff in the past as needed but never really kept a record of it.

so, this repository will ultimately (hopefully) contain some useful and reusable tools, but in the short term at least
will be primarily a learning exercise in both Git and Python/Netmiko.

my intent is to move stuff that works across to the live folder, regardless of how useful it might be. Although I feel I'm 
missing something about Git branches here, if I see there is a better way to differentiate between test/dev and prod i will  
implement that also.
